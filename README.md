# Exploring Factors Affecting Life Expectancies By State and Gender *Dataset Project*

## **Introduction**

### What is your general motivation for this topic? Provide some context that explains why the topic is interesting or important to you.
This topic interests me because since I was 6 I have been volunteering for a shelter in Stamford called Inspirica which is a place where homeless and housing-insecure youth and families can live and go to rehab, become more financially literate, and eventually be placed in permanent housing. I've always been curious about how income can affect the quality and length of a person's life and how that varies around the US. We are fortunate to live in an area that focuses on the needs of others (like this shelter) probably partially due to the fact that we can financially contribute. When I was volunteering I would mainly attend Arts and Crafts and Reading nights with the children living in the shelter but when COVID hit, these programs were shut down and I knew IOnspirica could use all the help it could get. Because of this, I founded a 501c3 organization called Heart to Art which raised over $150,000 last year for Inspirica and I hope to continue to combat this problem. I am really interested in this dataset because if life expectancy is affected by income level, how do we create a more equitable way of living/ how do we give those with lower income levels equal/similar access to the healthcare help they may need to live long, healthy lives? I'm also curious to see if there are regional differences or political differences by state and if that affects life expectancy.


### What are the 2-3 specific questions you attempted to answer?
1. Do people in lower income quartiles tend to have lower life expectancies in the US?
2. Do the states of a certain political vote status (dem, rep, switch) have a generally higher life expectancy?

### *Dataset -->* Describe what you know about how the data was generated. If possible, include information about who owns the datasaet and why you are able to use it 

### *Process -->* How did you go about answering your questions? What specific pieces of information did you need from your data set and how did you combine data to arrive at your answer?

### *Challenges -->* What difficulties did you run into, and how did you approach solving them?

### What did the data show? What are your takeaways? Plots might be helpful (though not required) depending on your question. Make sure to also discuss the limitations of your research.

### What are some related or additional questions that you would explore if you had more time and resources?
